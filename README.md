# Star Wars API
This project is a challenge from B2W to implement a API using REST to manage data from planets according to [swapi](https://swapi.co/).

Here you will find a Start Wars API project using Java, Spring Boot and MongoDB for this solution purpose.

## Requirements:

- The API must be REST;

- For each planet, the following data must be obtained from the application database and entered manually:
	- name
	- climate
	- terrain

- For each planet we must also have the number of movie appearances that can be obtained through the public Star Wars API: https://swapi.co/

## Desired Features:

- Add a planet (with name, climate e terrain);
- List Planets;
- Search by name;
- Search by Id;
- Remove a planet;
